         * 1- working directory = current working area, it is where files live

         * 2- index directory (staging area) = after .add comment
           2.1- after creating another class java will ask us to add file to GIT. 4
             - if you add it will be on index directory, if you dont it will be on working directory
               - added classes will be green, not-added classes will contain red color

         * 3- we can add a non-added class inside GitHub later on by right click onto class (CLICK GIT AND ADD)

         * 4- When class is blue that means something changed inside the class.

         * 5- when we have directory GIT cannot track the class (code) but with index GIT can track the code

         * 6- You can roll back the indexed classes to be untracked
